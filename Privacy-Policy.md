## What data does Vocabify use?
Vocabify uses the following data:
- **WaniKani Data**: Your WaniKani API key is used to access information from your WaniKani account, such as your current level, vocabulary, and progress. This data is used to identify which vocabulary to translate.
- **User Preferences**: Settings that you configure within the app to personalise your experience. Depending on the browser that you use, some of these settings may be synced across devices. This is done through the browser's built-in storage mechanisms, and is not managed by Vocabify.
- **Usage Data**: Information about how you interact with the app may be collected in the future to provide statistics to the user. This data would again be stored locally on your device, not transmitted off your device, or shared with any third parties.
